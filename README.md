## **Description**
This quiz has been built to dynamically populate the screen using Javascript. There are 2 separate HTML files, one is used for the main screen, the quiz questions, and the score submission page, while the other is used for the high-scores. The quiz questions will be shown to the user 1 at a time. When they click the answer they want the next question will be generated and they will get notified if they were right or wrong. The users score for the quiz is how many seconds they have remaining when they finish. There are 75 seconds total and their score is deducted by 10 seconds for any incorrect choice. After the quiz is over the user will have a chance to input their initials and then once they submit they will be directed to the high-scores page. The scores are saved locally on the users computer and will persist there until they click the "Clear Scores" button.
