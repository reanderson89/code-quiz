var body = document.querySelectorAll("body");

// var h1 = document.createElement("h1");
// h1.textContent = "Hello World";
// document.body.appendChild(h1);

// main screen has a "start quiz" button with some writing above it. 

// The timer in the top right is set to 0 until start quiz is clicked then it is set to 75.

// There is a "View Highscores" button in the top left that when clicked lists out all of the scores. (maybe top 5).

// on click of start quiz the screen changes to a question and the timer begins to countdown from 75 seconds. 

// on click of an answer the screen changes again, on the next screen text flashes underneath the answers telling you if you are right or wrong.

// If you are wrong then you lose 15 seconds from your time.

// If you finish the quiz before time runs out then your score is total time remaining.

// if time reaches 0 before you finish all of the questions, your score would be 0. Better luck next time.

// When you get your score you input your name and submit it, the screen then changes to the highscores page where you can see your score.
